# DMultiFreq

The second ratcheting simulation!
This is actually extremely similar to DBiharmonic, down to the sloppy 'a.out'.
The only real difference between these is we now have the P.txt and Q.txt files to work with.
Those files are used so that corresponding rows between the two files give the ratios used.

One might also notice FortranRunner2, which is identical to 1 but has 40 values for phi rather than 20.
This was deemed necessary because of the complexity of the movement in multi-frequency.
Until this is updated further, follow all instructions for Biharmonic to run MultiFrequency.
